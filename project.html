    <h1>"The joy of morning walk" </h1>
    <p>
        There’s something magical about the early hours of the day—the soft glow of the rising sun, the quiet streets, and the crisp, fresh air. A morning walk isn’t just a peaceful way to start your day—it’s also a powerful habit that can transform your health, mind, and mood.

In a world that moves fast and never seems to slow down, taking even 20 minutes to walk in the morning can feel like a reset button for your body and brain.
